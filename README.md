Description: Performs addition of two matrices.
Parameters:
matrixA: First matrix to be added.
matrixB: Second matrix to be added.
rows: Number of rows in the matrices.
columns: Number of columns in the matrices.
Example Usage:
java
Copy code
int[][] matrixA = {{1, 2}, {3, 4}};
int[][] matrixB = {{5, 6}, {7, 8}};
int rows = 2;
int columns = 2;
int[][] result = c1.matrixAddition(matrixA, matrixB, rows, columns);
sortAscending(int[] array)
Description: Sorts an array in ascending order.
Parameters:
array: Array to be sorted.
Example Usage:
java
Copy code
int[] array = {4, 2, 7, 1, 5};
c1.sortAscending(array);
calculateStats(int[] array)
Description: Calculates the maximum, minimum, and average of an array.
Parameters:
array: Array for statistical calculations.
Returns: An array containing maximum value, minimum value, and average.
